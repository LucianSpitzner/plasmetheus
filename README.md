Plasmetheus is a tool that calculates absorption spectra of exospheric particles around exoplanets. It uses data of the [AMITIS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017JPhCS.837a2017F/abstract) code (Fatemi et. al. 2017)

The project has been developed as part of the master's project by **Lucian Spitzner**, supervised by [**Jens Hoeijmakers**](https://github.com/Hoeijmakers). However, code structure of a model project by [**Andrea Gebek**'s Prometheus](https://github.com/andreagebek/Prometheus) has been used (their contributions are marked).
