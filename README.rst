Radiative transfer of exoplanet exospheres
==========================================

Plasmetheus is a tool that calculates absorption spectra of exospheric particles around exoplanets. It uses data of the [AMITIS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017JPhCS.837a2017F/abstract) code (Fatemi et. al. 2017)
